    "The prime numbers are not regularly spaced. For example from 2 to 3 the step is 1. From 3 to 5 the step is 2. From 7 to 11 it is 4. Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-steps primes:\n",

    "3, 5 - 5, 7, - 11, 13, - 17, 19, - 29, 31, - 41, 43\n",

    "We will write a function step with parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    g (integer >= 2) which indicates the step we are looking for,\n",
    "\n",
    "    m (integer >= 2) which gives the start of the search (m inclusive),\n",
    "\n",
    "    n (integer >= m) which gives the end of the search (n inclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above step(2, 2, 50) will return [3, 5] which is the first pair between 2 and 50 with a 2-steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this function should return the first pair of the two prime numbers spaced with a step of g between the limits m, n if these g-steps prime numbers exist otherwise nil or null or None or Nothing or [] or \"0, 0\" or {0, 0} or 0 0(depending on the language).\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "step(2, 5, 7) --> [5, 7] or (5, 7) or {5, 7} or \"5 7\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "See more examples for your language in \"TESTS\"\n",
    "Remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "([193, 197] is also such a 4-steps primes between 130 and 200 but it's not the first pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "step(6, 100, 110) --> [101, 107] though there is a prime between 101 and 107 which is 103; the pair 101-103 is a 2-step.\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of \"step\" is close to that of \"gap\" but it is not exactly the same. For those interested they can have a look at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeGaps.html.\n",
